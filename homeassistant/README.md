## House Package Layout

The house deployment loads its own `locations/house/packages/*.yaml` files.
Heating, lighting, washing machine, garage, go-e energy monitoring, HomeKit and
Zigbee2MQTT deployment are grouped by function. See the
[package map](locations/house/packages/README.md) for responsibilities and editing
conventions. `configuration.yaml` retains installation settings, frontend,
dashboard registration, Recorder, logging and file includes.

The shared `core/` directory is not automatically loaded by this house package
include. The flat configuration remains dormant.

## Key Features

### Multi-Location Support
- **Shared Core**: Common packages and templates in `/core/`
- **Location-Specific**: Separate configurations for house and flat
- **Git Subtree Deployment**: Each location has its own branch

### Working Components
- **CO2 Monitoring**: LaskaKit ESPlan + SCD41 sensors via MQTT
- **Area Management**: Consistent area definitions across locations
- **Person Tracking**: Shared person entities
- **HomeKit Integration**: Single bridge per location (no more confusion!)

### Safety Features
- **Secret Management**: Location-specific secrets files
- **No Hardcoded Secrets**: All sensitive data in secrets.yaml
- **Deployment Safety**: Testing on house before flat deployment

## Current Status

### ✅ Ready for House Deployment
- Core packages implemented
- House configuration complete
- CO2 sensors working (bedroom_co2_sensor)
- Deployment scripts ready

### ⚠️ Needs Device Renaming First
These Zigbee devices need friendly names in Zigbee2MQTT:
- `0x54ef441000edf7c1` → `bedroom_weather_sensor`
- `0xb4e3f9fffea76436` → `living_room_light_1`

### 🚧 Flat Configuration (Dormant)
- Template structure created
- All files are empty/dormant
- Ready for future activation

## Deployment Process

1. **Setup**: Follow `/deployment/README.md`
2. **House First**: Deploy and test house configuration
3. **Flat Later**: Activate flat when second location is ready

## Migration from Current Config

This replaces the messy current configuration with:
- Clean device names instead of hex IDs
- Single HomeKit bridge per location
- Proper area organization
- Configuration as code with Git

## Next Steps

1. Rename Zigbee devices to friendly names
2. Create Git subtree branches
3. Deploy to house NUC
4. Test and refine
5. Prepare flat configuration when needed
